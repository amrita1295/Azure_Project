            <p class="lead">Recognizing the urgency of turning vaccine doses into vaccinated, protected communities, WHO, UNICEF and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance launched the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership (CoVDP). The CoVDP builds on existing resources to support the AMC 92 and focuses foremost on the 34 countries that were at or below 10% coverage in January 2022. Working closely with countries to understand bottlenecks to vaccination, the CoVDP offers access to urgent operational funding, technical assistance and political engagement to rapidly scale up vaccination and monitor progress towards targets.</p>
